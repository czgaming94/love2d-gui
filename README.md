# LOVE2D GUI
This API's goal is to make laying out your application GUI simple and efficient.<br>
The secondary goal of this API is to be as easy to grasp as possible for beginners.<br>
There are a few different tools brought with this API...<br>
### [Boxes](http://google.com)
The goal of the box object is for backgrounds, buttons, and HUD containers. This is<br>
the most commonly used type of object in a GUI.
### [Text](http://google.com)
The text object has a few abilities. It can be treated as regular static text, or<br>
it can be treated as a typewriter, and given syntax coding to morph and affect how<br>
the text is displayed.
### [Checkbox](http://google.com)
The checkbox is designed to be used for taking user input on choices. A top use<br>
for the checkbox is for Poll option selection. Checkboxes can accept multiple<br>
selections, or be limited to a single selection.
## [Dropdown](http://google.com)
The dropdown is just as it sounds; A menu of options that drops down when clicked on.<br>
This is commonly used for toggling between user input options, form submissions, etc.
