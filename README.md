# LOVE2D GUI
This API's goal is to make laying out your application GUI simple and efficient. The secondary goal of this API 
is to be as easy to grasp as possible for beginners, as well as users coming from other scripting languages. 
There are a few different tools brought with this API...<br>
### [Boxes](https://github.com/czgaming94/love2d-gui/blob/main/docs/Box.md)

The goal of the box object is for backgrounds, buttons, and HUD containers. This is the most commonly used type of object in a GUI.

The text object has a few abilities. It can be treated as regular static text, or it can be treated as a typewriter, 
and given syntax coding to morph and affect how the text is displayed.
### [Checkboxes](https://github.com/czgaming94/love2d-gui/blob/main/docs/Checkbox.md)

The checkbox is designed to be used for taking user input on choices. A top use for the checkbox is for Poll option selection. 
Checkboxes can accept multiple selections, or be limited to a single selection.
